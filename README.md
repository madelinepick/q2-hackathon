# q2-hackathon

I wanted to learn d3.js bubble charts and make a more fun login UI while practing login, cookies etc.

* What did you think would be easy but wasn't?
I thought setting up cookies was easy, but I ran into a lot of simple mistakes with cookie-session.
* What did you think would be hard but was easy?
Validation was really simple and only took a couple minutes.
* What techniques did you successfully utilize to work in a team?
This didn't apply to me because I worked alone, but form observing I could tell communication was important. Who is on what branch or changing what page? Commit and push/pull often.
* What did you learn?
I learned a lot about combining cookies/logins/databases that I hadn't done from scratch before. In other exercises, we would work on one of those things and the others would be written for us. I learned the important of setting up and requiring modules in the begining.
* What did YOU kick ass at?
I think I did a good job finding answers online and including one new feature at a time.
* What is going into your learning queue?
I definitely want to get better/faster at setting up authentication (I didn't use oAuth in this project but would've liked to)
* How did your project scope change?
I had to take out animations I was hoping to create and didn't use my second db table like I'd hoped.
